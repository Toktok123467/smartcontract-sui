TOKTOK

# üéµ Toktok Stake-to-Vote Smart Contract (Sui Move)

**Toktok** is a memecoin-powered, AI music remix platform where users stake `$TOKTOK` tokens to vote for their favorite AI-generated battle tracks. This repository contains a Move-based smart contract for the **Sui blockchain** that enables a **stake-to-vote mechanism**.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Stake `$TOKTOK` tokens to vote in an AI-generated music battle.
- Each token staked counts as one vote.
- Battle creators can initiate and end voting rounds.
- Votes are tallied and stored on-chain.
- Tokens are locked during voting for fairness (burned in this version for simplicity).

- **Module Name:** `stake_vote_toktok`
- Decimals: 8

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 Tkt
Utility:

Distributed as rewards for active content creation and community engagement.
Enables on-chain governance and creator-led decisions.
- **Language:** [Move](https://github.com/move-language/move)
- **Chain:** [Sui Testnet](https://docs.sui.io/)
- **Coin Type:** `TOKTOK` (Custom `Coin<TOKTOK>`)
-  Smart Contract Purpose
The purpose of the stake_vote_toktok module is to:
Allow users to stake TokTok Tokens (TKT) to gain voting power in community proposals or rap battles.
Support creator competition-based governance (e.g., voting on winning AI-voice remix battles).
Enable reward distribution based on staked participation.
 How It Works
Staking:
Users stake TKT tokens to support a creator or battle participant.
Staked tokens are locked until the voting period ends.
Voting:
Voting power = Amount of tokens staked.
Users vote by staking on a creator‚Äôs profile or proposal ID.
Unstaking:
After the vote ends, users can unstake their TKT tokens.
Reward Distribution:
Rewards can be distributed to users who staked on the winning creator.
Creators can also receive bonus TKT based on votes earned.


Data Structures
struct RewardPool has key {
    id: UID,
    pool_balance: Balance<TokTokToken>,
}



 Updated Functions
public fun create_reward_pool(
    ctx: &mut TxContext
): RewardPool {
    let id = object::new(ctx);
    let pool_balance = balance::zero<TokTokToken>();
    RewardPool { id, pool_balance }
}


2. Fund the Reward Pool
public fun fund_pool(
    pool: &mut RewardPool,
    coins: Coin<TokTokToken>
) {
    balance::join(&mut pool.pool_balance, coin::into_balance(coins));
}
